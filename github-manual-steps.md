# Manual GitHub Repository Creation

Since the token doesn't have repository creation permissions, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create Repository Manually
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `K1-SDC`
3. Description: `A responsive web application for managing conversations, built with React.js and Node.js, with Docker containerization.`
4. Make it Public
5. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code Using Terminal

```bash
# Configure git (if not already done)
git config user.name "robdspain"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Update remote URL with your token
git remote set-url origin https://robdspain: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@github.com/robdspain/K1-SDC.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Repository
After pushing, your repository will be available at:
https://github.com/robdspain/K1-SDC

## Note
If you receive a "branch not found" error, try pushing to the master branch instead:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```
