# Manual GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Since we're experiencing authentication issues with the automated methods, here's a simple manual approach:

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `K1-SDC`
3. Description: `A responsive web application for managing conversations, built with React.js and Node.js, with Docker containerization.`
4. Set to Public
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Configure git (if not already done)
git config --global user.name "robdspain"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Initialize repository if not already initialized
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit for K1-SDC"

# Add remote repository and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/robdspain/K1-SDC.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: When prompted for username and password
1. Enter your GitHub username: `robdspain`
2. For password: Use a personal access token
   - If you don't have a new token, create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Make sure to give it "repo" permissions
   - Copy the token and use it as the password when prompted

## Step 4: Verify
After pushing, your repository will be available at:
https://github.com/robdspain/K1-SDC
